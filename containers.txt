<p>Step 2: Choose Your Containers</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve chosen a nice, sunny location to grow your plants in, the next essential element to any urban garden is what containers you&rsquo;ll use. There are several types that can do the job. What you choose will depend on what aesthetic you want as well as what kind of space you have.</p>
<p>Locations to Consider</p>
<p>Hanging Baskets. Hanging baskets are a great way of creating a tidy, clean and professional looking outdoor area. They are also up off the ground and out of the way.</p>
<p>Half Round Baskets. Similar to a hanging basket, these are up off the ground. However, these mount on a wall and make a great decoration.</p>
<p>Trellises. A Trellis is a wonderful tool for a vertical garden where you don&rsquo;t have much space. Grow your plants up rather than out.</p>
<p>Repurposed Household Containers. A great way to add a little character and help the planet, too, repurposed items can make great containers. You just need to make sure they have good drainage and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>Traditional Pots. These work well since growing plants is what they were designed for. The usually have holes for drainage built right in.</p>
<p>Wooden Containers. Wood containers come in a variety of sizes making them great for any space. Plus, it&rsquo;s easy to drill holes in the bottom for drainage.</p>
<p>Grow Bags. Made of flexible, lightweight fabric. Grow bags allows roots to breathe and prevents overwatering or overheating. They also fold up for easy storage.</p>
<p>Self-Watering Containers. If you have trouble remembering to water consistenly, these babies will change your life. These can be a DIY project or you can buy them.</p>
<p>Containers That Fit Over Railings. Only have a balcony railing to use? Balcony pots to the rescue. BAM!</p>
<p>Wall Containers. This has got to be one of my new recent obsessions. I believe vertical gardening is the way of the future. Why not put a perfectly good wall to use?</p>
