Benefits of Urban Gardening

Freshness - Anyone who has ever eaten a tomato right off the vine knows nothing beats eating ripe produce as soon as possible.

Sustainability - Eating local is one of the best things we can all do for the planet, and avoiding transportation energy costs is one of the main reasons why.

Access to Quality Food - Some residents in cities do not have access to high quality, affordable fresh fruits and vegetables. A community garden can make all the difference in the world.

Quality of Life - Urban farming can help strengthen your community, give you a sense of accomplishment, give you exercise, take advantage of unused resources, add more green space and more.

About 15% of the world's food supply is now grown in urban centers.
